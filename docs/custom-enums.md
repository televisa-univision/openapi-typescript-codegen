# Enum with custom names and descriptions

You can use `x-enum-varnames` and `x-enum-descriptions` in your spec to generate enum with custom names and descriptions.
It's not in official [spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/681) yet. But it's a supported extension
that can help developers use more meaningful enumerators.

```json
{
    "EnumWithStrings": {
        "description": "This is a simple enum with strings",
        "enum": [
            0,
            1,
            2
        ],
        "x-enum-varnames": [
            "Success",
            "Warning",
            "Error"
        ],
        "x-enum-descriptions": [
            "Used when the status of something is successful",
            "Used when the status of something has a warning",
            "Used when the status of something has an error"
        ]
    }
}
```

Generated code:

```typescript
enum EnumWithStrings {
    /*
    * Used when the status of something is successful
    */
    Success = 0,
    /*
    * Used when the status of something has a warning
    */
    Waring = 1,
    /*
    * Used when the status of something has an error
    */
    Error = 2,
}
```
