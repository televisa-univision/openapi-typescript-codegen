# Babel support

If you use enums inside your models / definitions then those enums are by default inside a namespace with the same name
as your model. This is called declaration merging. However, the [@babel/plugin-transform-typescript](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript)
does not support these namespaces, so if you are using babel in your project please use the `--useUnionTypes` flag
to generate union types instead of traditional enums. More info can be found here: [Enums vs. Union Types](#enums-vs-union-types---useuniontypes).

**Note:** If you are using Babel 7 and Typescript 3.8 (or higher) then you should enable the `onlyRemoveTypeImports` to
ignore any 'type only' imports, see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript#onlyremovetypeimports for more info

```javascript
module.exports = {
    presets: [
        ['@babel/preset-typescript', {
            onlyRemoveTypeImports: true,
        }],
    ],
};
```
